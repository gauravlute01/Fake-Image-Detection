# Fake-Image-Detection
- Collected and prepared a diverse dataset of real and fake images.
- Resized the images for optimal input to the model.
- Trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
- Evaluated the modelâ€™s performance by calculating the accuracy score.
